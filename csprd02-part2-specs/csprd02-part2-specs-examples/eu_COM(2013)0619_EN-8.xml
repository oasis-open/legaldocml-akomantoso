							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_1">A growing number of new psychoactive
                                substances, which imitate the effects of substances controlled under
                                the UN Conventions on Drugs and are marketed as legal alternatives
                                to them (‘legal highs’), are emerging and spreading fast in the
                                internal market. These substances, which act on the central nervous
                                system, modifying mental functions, also have uses in industry or
                                research - as active substances for medicines, for instance. A
                                rising number of individuals, in particular young people, consume
                                <term refersTo="#newPsychoactiveSubstance">new psychoactive substances</term>, despite the risks that they may pose,
                                which may be comparable to those posed by UN-controlled drugs.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_2">During the past years, one new
                                psychoactive substance was reported every week in the EU, and the
                                rapid pace of notification is expected to continue in the coming
                                years. These substances are sold freely, unless public authorities
                                subject them to various restriction measures, underpinned by
                                administrative or criminal sanctions, because of the risks that they
                                pose when consumed by humans. Such national restriction measures,
                                which may differ depending on the Member State and on the substance,
                                can hamper trade in the internal market and hinder the development
                                of future industrial or commercial uses.</p>

                                proportionate EU action. It is accompanied by a proposal for a

                                around 290 substances. The number of notified substances tripled
                                between 2009 and 2012 (from 24 to 73). Around 80% of these

							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_7">Consumption of new psychoactive
                                substances appears to be increasing in Europe and use is predominant
                                among young people. According to the 2011 Eurobarometer ‘Youth
                                attitudes on drugs’, 5% of young people in the EU have used such
                                substances at least once in their life, with a peak of 16% in
                                Ireland, and close to 10% in Poland, Latvia and the UK. According to
                                the results of snapshot surveys conducted by the EMCDDA, the number
                                of online shops selling new psychoactive substances increased
                                four-fold between 2010 and 2012, to 690.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_8">The consumption of new psychoactive
                                substances can cause harms to individuals' health and safety,
                                resulting in deaths, injury or disease, and can pose risks to and
                                burdens on society, as it may lead to violent behaviour and crime.
                                These risks are amplified by the fact that many such substances are
                                sold to consumers without appropriate labelling and instructions of
                                use. In some cases they are sold on the black market alongside, or
                                instead of, controlled drugs.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_9">The rapid emergence and spread of these
                                substances, and the potential risks that they pose, have led
                                national authorities to subject them to various restriction
                                measures. Hundreds such substances or <term refersTo="#mixture">mixtures</term> of substances have
                                been subjected to different restriction measures in the Member
                                States in the past years. Such national measures disrupt trade in
                                licit uses of these substances. Around a fifth of the substances
                                notified by the Member States have other uses (but information on
                                such uses is not collected systematically across the EU).</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_10">National restriction measures, which
                                can vary depending on the Member State and on the substance, lead to
                                obstacles to trade in licit uses, fragmentation, an uneven level
                                playing field and legal uncertainties for economic operators, and
                                make it difficult for companies to operate across the internal
                                market. They make research more cumbersome, hampering the
                                development of new uses for these substances. They have a
                                chain-reaction impact on operators in different markets, because
                                such substances are used in the production of other substances or
                                <term refersTo="#mixture">mixtures</term>, which in turn are used for manufacturing various goods. As
                                the market for new psychoactive substances is likely to grow, so
                                will these obstacles to licit trade.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_11">In order to facilitate the functioning
                                of the internal market while protecting consumers from harmful new
                                psychoactive substances, EU-level action shall ensure the free
                                movement of new psychoactive substances for commercial and
                                industrial use, and for scientific research and development, and
                                provide for a graduated set of restriction measures for substances
                                posing risks, proportionate to their level of risk.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_12">This proposal, therefore, sets up a
                                robust system for exchanging rapidly information on new psychoactive
                                substances emerging on the market, including on their commercial and
                                industrial uses, for assessing the risks of substances that cause
                                EU-wide concern and for withdrawing from the market those substances
                                that pose risks.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_13">The substances suspected to pose
                                immediate public health risk will be withdrawn from the consumer
                                market temporarily, pending their risk assessment. Once the risk
                                assessment is completed, measures will be taken proportionate to the
                                risks of substances. While no restrictions will be introduced at the
                                EU level on substances posing low health, social and safety risks,
                                substances posing moderate risks will be subjected to consumer
                                market restriction, which means that they cannot be sold to
                                consumers (except for uses specifically authorised, for instance by
                                medicines legislation) but their trade is allowed for commercial and
                                industrial purposes as well as for scientific research and
                                development.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_1.1__p_14">New psychoactive substances posing
                                severe risks will be subjected to permanent market restriction,
                                covering both the consumer and commercial markets, and their use
                                will only be possible for specifically authorised industrial and
                                commercial purposes, as well as for scientific research and
                                development. In addition, as explained above, these substances will
                                be subjected to EU criminal law provisions under the accompanying
                                proposal for a Directive amending the Framework Decision on illicit

                                authorities (responsible for drug legislation, justice and health
                                ministries, health institutes and law enforcement agencies) and of

							<p eId="tblock_2.1__p_2">The survey conducted among Member States

                                criminal penalties in the current instrument as inadequate and
                                suggest that a wider range of options should be considered, backed
                                by administrative law. Moreover, all Member States agreed that
                                swifter action is necessary to address new psychoactive substances
                                (including temporary measures) and that the current decision-making
                                process is too slow.</p>

                                stressed that the Council Decision and product safety legislation
                                are inadequate to tackle the large number of new psychoactive
                                substances emerging on the market, whose effects and risks are
                                mostly unknown. They pointed out that new legislation on new
                                psychoactive substances should be calibrated to the different levels
                                of risks posed by these substances. Certain participants expressed
                                concern that too rigorous policy responses (such as blanket
                                restrictions on entire groups of substances or a wide recourse to

                                include a displacement of substances from the licit to the illicit

                                with other substances, possibly even more harmful, and rendering

                                for recreational use. Recreational users of new psychoactive

							<p eId="tblock_3.2__p_1">There is a clear need for EU action on
                                new psychoactive substances. This is because Member States alone
                                cannot reduce the problems caused by the spread in the internal
                                market of harmful new psychoactive substances and by the
                                proliferation of divergent national responses. Uncoordinated
                                national action in this area can produce adverse knock-on effects,
                                for instance hindrance to the operation of the internal market as
                                far as licit trade in these substances is concerned or displacement
                                of harmful substances from one Member State to another.</p>
							<p eId="tblock_3.2__p_2">Consequently, EU-level action is
                                necessary to ensure that potentially harmful new psychoactive
                                substances, which cause EU-wide concern, can be identified, assessed
                                and, if they pose risks, withdrawn from the market rapidly in all

                                not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives because it
                                only addresses new psychoactive substances that are a concern at the

								<p>EU action on new psychoactive substances would boost the exchange
                                    of information among the Member States, with the clear added
                                    value of alerting Member States to potentially harmful
                                    substances that have emerged in other Member States, to help
                                    them anticipate a potential public health threat. The assessment
                                    of risks of substances at the EU level has the added value of
                                    pooling scientific resources and analytical capacities from
                                    across the EU, to provide the best evidence available on a
                                    substance and help develop effective responses to it. EU-level
                                    decisions on restricting the availability of harmful substances
                                    would increase legal certainty and reduce obstacles for economic
                                    operators in the market for legitimate uses, while improving
