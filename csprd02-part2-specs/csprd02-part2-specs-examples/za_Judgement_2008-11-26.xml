						<p> The appellant ('Fourway') is a long distance haulier. The respondent
                            ('the Agency') owes its existence to the <ref eId="ref_01" href="/akn/za/act/1998-03-31/7">South African National Roads Agency
                                Limited and National Roads Act 7 of 1998</ref> ('the Act'). The
                            dispute between them originates from an accident which occurred in the
                            early evening of 26 September 2003 on the N1 national road between
                            Polokwane and Mokopane in the Limpopo province. The two vehicles
                            involved were an articulated truck and a light delivery van. The
                            articulated truck was driven at the time by an employee of Fourway who
                            was acting in the course and scope of his employment. </p>
					</item>
					<item eId="background__list_1__item_2">
						<num>[2]</num>
						<p> The articulated truck was on its way from an asbestos mine in Zimbabwe
                            to Durban harbour carrying about 34 tonnes of chrysolite asbestos,
                            destined for export. As a result of the collision, the truck overturned
                            and spilled its cargo onto practically the entire surface of a portion
                            of the national road and its surroundings. Because of the hazardous
                            nature of asbestos powder, the spillage required an extensive
                            cleaning-up and decontamination operation. </p>
					</item>
					<item eId="background__list_1__item_3">
						<num>[3]</num>
						<p> To facilitate the cleaning-up and decontamination process, the traffic
                            authorities closed the section of the national road involved and
                            diverted the traffic in both directions onto an alternative road. This
                            lasted for about 24 hours. The section of the national road which was
                            closed forms part of a toll road. The alternative route was not subject
                            to toll. As a result of the closure, two toll plazas – as defined in the
                            Act – could not collect toll fees. Based on these facts, the agency as
                            the entity authorised by <ref eId="ref_03" href="/akn/za/act/1998-03-31/7/eng@/!main.xml#sec27">s 27</ref> of the
                            Act to levy and collect toll fees on toll roads, instituted an action in
                            delict against Fourway for the damages it allegedly suffered in the form
                            of loss of toll revenue in an amount of <span class="damageAmount">R105 996.67. </span>

						<p> At the commencement of the trial, the parties asked the court a quo
                                (<span refersTo="#Rabie">Rabie J</span>) to order a separation of
                            issues. In terms of the separation order, the issues relating to the
                            liability of Fourway were to be decided first, while the quantum of the
                            Agency's alleged damages stood over for later determination. The
                            preliminary issues were decided in favour of the agency. Hence the court
                            declared Fourway liable for such damages as the Agency may prove in
                            respect of the lost revenue it would have collected at the two toll
                            plazas involved, but for the closure of the road. It also ordered
                            Fourway to pay the costs of the preliminary proceedings. Fourway's
                            appeal against that judgment is with the leave of the court a quo. </p>

					<item eId="introduction__list_1__item_5">

						<p> Part of the controversy on appeal was brought about by a shift in the
                            focus of the defence advanced by Fourway and the resulting mutation of
                            the issues involved. A convenient starting point for an account of the
                            mutation is the opening address by counsel for the Agency, as plaintiff,
                            at the beginning of the trial. With reference to the pleadings, counsel
                            at that stage defined the issues between the parties as follows:

                            Counsel for Fourway did not react to this definition of the issues. 
                            During the trial, Fourway formally conceded the issue referred to in 
                            <ref eId="ref_1" href="#int-list1-ite2-lis1-ite1">(a)</ref> and the evidence led by the parties therefore 
                            dealt exclusively with the issues in <ref eId="ref_2" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_b">(b)</ref> and 
                            <ref eId="ref_3" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_c">(c)</ref>. 
                            But in argument at the end of the trial, Fourway's counsel, for the first time, raised two
                            further contentions. First he submitted that the Agency's claim was for the recovery of 
                            pure economic loss which required the existence of a legal duty on the part of Fourway and
                            that the Agency had failed to plead or establish the existence of such a legal duty. 
                            Secondly he submitted that the Agency had failed to establish the requirement of legal 
                            causation with reference to the loss which formed the basis of its claim.

						<p> 
                            As we know from the result, the court a quo dismissed all defences relied on by 
                            Fourway, including those originally raised under what I categorised as 
                            <ref eId="ref_4" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_b">(b)</ref> and 
                            <ref eId="ref_5" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_c">(c)</ref>, 
                            as well as the two new ones advanced for the first time in argument at the end of 
                            the trial. As to <ref eId="ref_6" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_b">(b)</ref> and 
                            <ref eId="ref_7" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_c">(c)</ref> the court found on the evidence 
                            presented that the negligence of Fourway's employee was the cause of the collision 
                            which necessitated both the decontamination process and the closure of the road. 
                            With regard to the defence based on the concept of pure economic loss, the court 
                            essentially held that the damage suffered by the agency did not amount to pure 
                            economic loss and that the question regarding the existence of a legal duty 
                            therefore did not arise. Finally the court held that the damages claimed could not 
                            be classified as too remote and that the requirement of legal causation had thus 
                            been satisfied.

						<p> 
                            On appeal, it was conceded on behalf of Fourway that the court a quo was correct 
                            in deciding the issues under  <ref eId="ref_8" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_b">(b)</ref> and 
                            <ref eId="ref_9" href="#introduction__list_1__item_5_list_1__item_c">(c)</ref> against it. In consequence, the only 
                            issues on appeal turned on the contentions that were raised for the first time in 
                            argument at the end of the trial. They can be summarised thus:

                            The court a quo's finding that the damages claimed did not result from pure 
                            economic loss clearly emanated from its understanding of that concept. 
                            That understanding appears from the following statements in the judgment:
                            <span class="citation">
                                'The economic loss in this sense comprises patrimonial loss that does not 
                                result from a direct invasion of a subjective right of the person who 
                                suffered the loss.'
                            </span>
							 
                            And that  
							<span class="citation">
                                'the aforesaid rights of the plaintiff. . .

                                fees] were clearly subjective rights worthy of protection and which the 
                                plaintiff could enforce against other people.'
                            </span>
							 
                            And that

                                subjective rights which was as such unlawful.'

                            I do not share the court a quo's understanding of what is meant by 
                            'pure economic loss' in the present context.
                            I believe its meaning to be far less metaphysical. As explained by Harms JA in 
                            <ref href="/akn/za/judgment/SA491/eng@/!main.xml#" eId="ref_11">Telematrix (Pty) Ltd v Advertising Standards Authority SA 2006 (1) SA 461 (SCA) </ref>
                            para 1, it means simply this:
                            <span class="citation">
                                '"Pure economic loss" in this context connotes loss 
                                that does not arise directly from damage to the plaintiff's person or property 
                                but rather in consequence of the negligent act itself, such as loss of profit, 
                                being put to extra expenses or the diminution in the value of property.'

                            Thus understood, the Agency's claim, in my view, falls squarely within the ambit of 
                            pure economic loss. As formulated, its claim was for loss of revenue in the form of 
                            toll fees resulting from the closure of the road. The Agency did not allege, 
                            nor did it set out to prove in evidence, that it was the owner of the road; 
                            that the road was physically damaged by the collision; or that the closure of the road 
                            resulted from any physical damage to the road. The Agency's argument on appeal, 
                            that in terms of <ref eId="ref_16" href="/akn/za/act/1998-03-31/7/eng@/!main.xml#sec27">s 7</ref> of 
                            the Act it was in fact the owner of the road on which the 
                            collision occurred, is of no consequence and misses the point. For present purposes 
                            the question is not whether the Agency is in fact the owner of the road. 
                            The point is that it did not rely on such ownership to support its claim.

                            Recognition that we are dealing with a claim for pure economic loss brings in its 
                            wake a different approach to the element of wrongfulness. 
                            This results from the principles which have been formulated by this court so many 
                            times in the recent past that I believe they can by now be regarded as trite. 
                            These principles proceed from the premise that negligent conduct which manifests 
                            itself in the form of a positive act causing physical damage to the property or 
                            person of another is prima facie wrongful. By contrast, negligent causation of 
                            pure economic loss is not regarded as prima facie wrongful. 
                            Its wrongfulness depends on the existence of a legal duty. 
                            The imposition of this legal duty is a matter for judicial determination involving 
                            criteria of public or legal policy consistent with constitutional norms. 
                            In the result, conduct causing pure economic loss will only be regarded as wrongful
                            and therefore actionable if public or legal policy considerations require that such
                            conduct, if negligent, should attract legal liability for the resulting damages 
                            (see eg <ref href="/akn/za/judgment/ 20026SA431SCA/eng@/!main.xml#par12" eId="ref_17">
								<i>Minister of Safety and Security v Van Duivenboden</i> 2002 (6) SA 431 (SCA)

                            In this light, so Fourway contended on appeal, the Agency was obliged to allege 
                            in its pleadings not only that the negligent conduct relied upon was wrongful, 
                            but that it also had to allege and prove the facts relied upon to substantiate 
                            the considerations of policy giving rise to a legal duty on the part of Fourway's 
                            employee. As a result of the Agency's failure to adhere to these rules of 
                            litigation, so the argument went, neither the policy considerations relevant 
                            to the question of wrongfulness, nor the factual basis underlying such policy 
                            considerations, were identified and investigated during the trial. 
                            In consequence, so the argument concluded, it would be prejudiced if the issue of 
                            wrongfulness were to be summarily disposed of at the appeal. 
                            Fourway therefore suggested that, unless this court upholds its contention that 
                            the damages claimed are too remote – to which I shall presently return – the 
                            issue of wrongfulness should be postponed and decided with the rest of the issues 
                            concerning the quantum of the Agency's damages, which are standing over in any 
                            event.

                            The proposition that a plaintiff claiming pure economic loss must allege 
                            wrongfulness, and plead the facts relied upon to support that essential allegation,
                            is in principle well founded. In fact, the absence of such allegations may render 
                            the particulars of claim exipiable on the basis that no cause of action had been 
                            disclosed (see eg <i>Trope v SA Reserve Bank</i> 1992 (3) SA 208 (T) at 214A-G; 
                            <i>Indac Electronics (Pty) Ltd v Volkskas Bank Ltd</i> 1992 (1) SA 783 (A) 797E; 
                            <i>Telematrix (supra)</i> para 2). But, as we know, Fourway did not file an 
                            exception. The trial proceeded without any objection on its part. 
                            In the circumstances it would be futile to investigate whether an exception, 
                            if properly and timeously taken, would have been successful. 
                            As I see it, the question is rather whether, despite the lack of necessary 
                            allegations in the Agency's pleadings, Fourway had sufficient opportunity 
                            to produce the facts it would seek to rely on for the determination of the policy 
                            considerations pertaining to wrongfulness in its favour. Conversely stated, 
                            the question is whether Fourway has shown prejudice, in the sense that it would 
                            have conducted its case in a materially different way if the Agency's claim for 
                            pure economic loss had been properly pleaded. 
                            (See eg <i>Shill v Milner</i> 1937 AD 101 at 105; 
                            <i>Robinson v Randfontein Estates GM Co Ltd</i> 1925 AD 173 at 198; 
                            <i>Collen v Rietfontein Engineering Works</i> 1948 (1) SA 413 (A) at 433; 
                            <i>Stead v Conradie</i> 1995 (2) SA 111 (A) at 122A-H.)

						<p>
                            As I see it, the proposal by Fourway that the issue of wrongfulness be referred back 
                            for determination by the trial court therefore depends on the outcome of two discrete 
                            enquiries. First, can this court, on the basis of the facts available, decide that, 
                            as a matter of policy, Fourway should be held liable for the loss of revenue claimed 
                            by the Agency? If not, that would be the end of the matter. 
                            The Agency would have failed to make out a case. A decision on the other hand that 
                            the issue of wrongfulness should on the facts available be determined in favour of 
                            the Agency will lead to the next enquiry. The question is: can it be said that, 
                            if the issue of wrongfulness had been properly pleaded by the Agency, 
                            Fourway would have conducted its case any differently? If not, the Agency is entitled 
                            to succeed. It is therefore only a finding of potential prejudice on the part of 
                            Fourway that can justify a referral back to the trial court.
